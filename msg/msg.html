        <p id="typewriter">Happy birthday, love! I'm hoping that 2023 so far has been nothing<br>
            but good to you. I hope that no matter how bad your day gets,<br>
            at the end of it, I hope you get to smile. Remember that even if it<br>
            isn't that often anymore that we get to reach out to each other and ask how<br>
            things are, i hope you remember that you can always run to me. With that,<br>
            please don't ever at any instances think that you're alone. You always have me.<br>
            This time, I hope you get to be genuinely happy, because you've been<br>
            strong enough, Alijah. You deserve to be happy and to be living life to its fullest,<br>
            not just strong. I'll always be rooting for that one thing for you.<br><br>

            Your light is one of the brightest and warmest I know. Stay as you are because you're<br>
            amazing like that.<br><br>

            And please remember that even if i'll be far away soon, i will always be there<br>
            for you, regardless. <br></br>

            I have so much of you in my heart. I hope you know that
